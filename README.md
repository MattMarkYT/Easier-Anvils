This is my first mod. I'm not a professional.
 
Easy Anvils, but server-side

It may not be compatible with other mods. It may be unstable.

Features:
- Heal anvils using iron blocks
- Format codes in item names by using & in place of ยง
- Free item renaming (doesn't damage anvil)
- "Too expensive" workaround by putting tool in main hand and book, item, or ingredient in off hand, then interacting with anvil (punch anvil to check cost first. Cost capped to 55 levels, may add mod config later to change value)
